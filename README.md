<p align="justified"> 

A coffee bean vendor, in business for the past four years, sells four types of coffee beans to a diverse customer base across several countries. Each variety is available in three roast types and four package sizes, with a loyalty card program offered to customers. The vendor now aims to develop a dashboard to generate valuable business insights from this data.

<p align="justified"> 

By filtering the dataset based on timeline, roast type, package size, and customer loyalty card status, the dashboard provides the following insights:

- A Year/Quarter/Month/Day wise view of sales revenue for each coffee bean, roast type, and package size.
- The total sales revenue by country.
- The top five customers based on sales amount.
- A breakdown of sales by customer loyalty card status.
